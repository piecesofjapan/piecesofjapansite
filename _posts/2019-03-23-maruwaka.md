<p>Maruwaka Hirotoshi is an award-winning designer and one of the
founders of GEN GEN AN by <a href="https://en-tea.com/pages/gengenan">EN TEA</a>, a Tokyo-based
tea house that’s actively broadening notions of what Japanese tea can and
should look like. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Even before becoming a tea master for the new millennium, Maruwaka
straddled the worlds of commercial celebrity and traditional artisanry. After a
career in retail, Maruwaka broke with an industry increasingly moving toward
fast-fashion, and tapped into the downtempo pace of Japanese craftsmanship, learning
techniques like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kutani_ware">Kutaniyaki</a>,
or porcelain making. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But a move that seemed like an attempt in code-switching to the language of traditional arts was ironically what enabled Maruwaka to speak more fluently as a commercial designer. It was around this time that he produced some of his best-known works, including a candy jar shaped like a human skull, and modern bento boxes in a collaboration with Puma.</p>

<p>Despite a string of design successes, Maruwaka was troubled by the
superficiality of his creations, things that paid tribute to Japanese
handicrafts but seemed like so many tchotchkes, Japanese souvenirs for a
foreign tourist. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But tea changed all of this. During his travels as an illustrious young designer, Maruwaka had come to realize that Japanese tea was a hot commodity – green tea was by then a global health tonic, and matcha had infiltrated stylish cafes from Paris to Los Angeles. By a stroke of fate, he met Shunichi Matsuo, the progeny of tea growers from Saga Prefecture. The two joined forces to create EN TEA, a company that aims to reconnect the “tea drinker” with the “tea field.”</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maruwaka and Shunichi source their tea leaves from organic growers in Japan who avoid pesticides and toxic fertilizers. Using traditional cultivation methods, they create tea of the highest quality, with flavors as delicate and deep as a Japanese tea ceremony.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Like the tea ceremony, GEN GEN AN by EN TEA uses the forms of the ordinary to create something extraordinary. Their custom blends – cold brew green tea, yuzu tea, tea lattes with German chamomile – both honor and defy classic impressions of Japanese tea. In 2017, under Maruwaka’s direction EN TEA took part in a highly-acclaimed interactive art installation by TeamLab in which digitally-rendered flowers appeared in translucent tea cups. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>GEN GEN AN’s aesthetic is hip, sleek, and breathlessly Instagrammable, but that doesn’t seem to bother Maruwaka, an artist who has built a career on remixing ideas of conventional craftsmanship. Indeed, it’s through this spirit of innovation that EN TEA is carving out new traditions in the way of tea.</p>
