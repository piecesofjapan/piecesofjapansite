When traveling to Japan most people often visit the big urban areas such as Tokyo and Kyoto, but you haven't really seen Japan if you haven't gone to the country side. Over 80% of Japan consists of mountains and woods and the the beautiful 17 room Beniya Mukayu is located in the midst of them. The architect planned many of their spaces to include as much of the surrounding landscape as possible.

The cuisine is carefully crafted and the menu adjusted to use as much of the local, seasonal ingredients as possible. The food comes served in regional&nbsp;Kutani pottery or Yamanaka and Wajima lacquerware all hand crafted.
