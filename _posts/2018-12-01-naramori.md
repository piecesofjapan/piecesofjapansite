Japan is known for its "Capsule Hotels" but newly opened one in Nara stands out. Often the hotels have very little to do with craftsmanship but the "Nara Forest Hotel" is different. This hotel's signature is the generous use of Japanese cypress carefully integrated in each guest room, the entrance are and even in the beautiful details of the ceiling.

Cypress can be found in many historical buildings in Nara and across Japan, one of them being the oldest wood structure Goju-no-to (The five-storied Pagoda) that dates back 1300 years.

The material is extremely durable, act as a insect repellant and has disinfecting qualities. It is also known for its relaxing aroma which is why it can often be found in baths.
