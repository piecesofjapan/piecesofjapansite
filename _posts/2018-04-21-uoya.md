Does it ever happen to you that you come across some amazing designs and end up finding out that one person is behind it? In my case that person that captured my attention is Shigenori Uoya, an architect in Kyoto specializing in Machiya (Japanese for "town house") remodels.

First time I saw is work was when a friend told me about the <a href="http://kyotomoyashihouse.com/">Moyashi House</a>. 120 years ago the house used to serve as a plantation site for seed malt used in the sake production and was called "Moyashi". Today the house can be used as a guest house, an event space and many other things which you can inquire about <a href="http://kyotomoyashihouse.com/">on their site</a>.

A few months later I met Sayuri Ikeda, one of the founders of <a href="https://www.corporate.viajes-jp.com/">Viajes, Inc.</a>&nbsp;who was the mastermind behind <a href="http://kyotomoyashihouse.com/">Moyashi House</a>&nbsp;and has since worked with the architect on another project called the <a href="https://www.tsukihihouse.com/">Tsukihi House</a>. From the outside the house looks like many others you'll see in Kyoto but when you enter it you'll be surprised by the interior design. This house now serves as a guest house accommodating 2 people and can booked on <a href="https://www.tsukihihouse.com/">their website</a>.

The last house I'm going to introduce here is <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/23886423?s=51">Maana Homes</a>. They popped up in one of my Instagram recommendations which I of course <a href="https://www.instagram.com/maanahomes/">immediately followed</a>. I only found out recently that this house was also renovated by Uoya-san.

Shigenori Uoya has recently also joined a new Houzz-like community called <a href="https://www.zenvita.com/professionals/shigenori-uoya">ZenVita</a>&nbsp;where you can see <a href="https://www.zenvita.com/professionals/shigenori-uoya">more of his projects</a>&nbsp;and even get in touch with him!
